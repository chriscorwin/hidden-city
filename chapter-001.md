# Hidden City

"We jump through it. I think."

She looked at me like D: , jumped into the hole, and disappeared into the city below.

This despite the fact that _the hole_ was two inches around, was five foot up the back wall of Target, near the back to school stuff.

Also, and this is important, the other side of the  back wall of Target near the back to school stuff _did not have a city behind it_, _could not have a city behind it_, because what _was_ there was a men's washroom.

I know: I had just used it.
