# Hidden City

"We jump through it. I think."

She looked at me like D: , jumped into the hole, and disappeared into the city below.

This despite the fact that _the hole_ was two inches around, was five foot up a wall in ::explore-place::, and on the other side of the wall not only did _not_ have a city there, but could not have one, because what was there was a men's washroom.

I know: I had just used it.
