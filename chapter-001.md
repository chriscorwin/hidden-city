# Hidden City

"We jump through it. ...I think."

She looked at me like D: , jumped into the hole, and disappeared into the city below.

This despite the fact that "the hole" was maaaayyybe two inches around and was at least five foot up the back wall of Target (near the back to school stuff).

Also—and this is important—the other side of the back wall of Target (near the back to school stuff ) _did not have a city behind it_.

It could not have a city behind it because what _was_ behind it was the men's washroom.

I know: I had just used it.
